# TableTennisSpeedTracker

A project to estimate the speed and trajectory of a ping-pong ball using video analysis and machine learning techniques. This repository leverages tools like Roboflow and YOLO for object detection and tracking.

## Features
- Detects and tracks a ping-pong ball in video footage.
- Estimates the ball's instantaneous and average speed.
- Provides trajectory visualization for better insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Roboflow**: For dataset preparation and annotation.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For real-time object detection.
- **Python**: Main programming language for processing and analysis.
- **OpenCV**: For video frame processing and visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ping-Pong-Ball-Speed-Estimator.git
   cd Ping-Pong-Ball-Speed-Estimator
